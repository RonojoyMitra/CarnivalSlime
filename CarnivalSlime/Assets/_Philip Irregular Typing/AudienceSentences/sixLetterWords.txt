037Can you buy me a hot dog? I'm pretty hungry right now.
033Wait what happened? My vision is blurred.
020Oh please! I can do better than that slime on stage!
031Stop talking! Can't you remain silent for once?
036I wish I could give that slime some advice right now.
050I personally don't think this trick is impressive anyway.
048How can the slime see anything? The stage is so bright.
002I cannot see from this seat. Can you move over?
037Don't make a mistake, slime, or I'll demand a refund. 
054Wow, this slime is probably the smartest slime in the nation.
015I know this is random, but have you ever seen a mermaid before?
041What's the point of this trick? It's not useful to anyone.
