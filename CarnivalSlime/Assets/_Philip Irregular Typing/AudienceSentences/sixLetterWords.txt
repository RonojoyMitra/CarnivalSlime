028Do they sell food here? I'm hungry.
024What happened there? My vision is blurry.
020Oh please! I can do better than that slime on stage!
039Stop talking, sir! You ought to remain silent for once?
036I wish I could give that slime some advice right now.
050I personally don't think this trick is impressive anyway.
039How can the slime see? The stage is so bright.
002I cannot see from this seat. Can you move over?
031Don't make a mistake, slime. I demand nothing short of perfection.
057Wow, this slime is probably the smartest creature in the nation.
015I know this is random, but have you ever seen their mermaid before?
041What's the point of this trick? It's not useful to anyone.
