020Look around at this audience! It's packed! Barnum seems to have really stirred up a storm. 
011I am quite honestly bored right now. I thought this act was going to be more entertaining!
034That slime must be under a lot of pressure right now. I read in the papers that Barnum treats them poorly! 
040I knew a date at the museum wouldn’t be romantic... She’s more interested in the slime than she is in me!
086I wonder how much practice this slime had to do to spell the words out with this much accuracy!
068This slime thing is quite special. Have not seen anything like this anywhere in our country! 
063The museum is lucky to have such a great money-making machine. Business must be booming!
040Wow, I should bring my son here for his birthday. He would love everything going on right now. 
062If the slime messed up right now, would it have the spirit to continue or would it get embarrassed and run off stage?
086That slime is so adorable. Maybe I should take it and run! Wait, that would make me a criminal! 
071I never thought I would be so entertained by an alleged slime, but I’m enjoying this quite a bit right now!
067Where the heck did Barnum find a slime? I’ve never seen a slime in wildlife anywhere!
