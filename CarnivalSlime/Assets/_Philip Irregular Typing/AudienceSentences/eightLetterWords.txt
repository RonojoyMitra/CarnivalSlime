027Look around at this packed audience! I didn’t expect there to be so many people coming to watch a little slime perform. 
005I am honestly incredibly bored right now. I thought this circus act was going to be more entertaining!
036That slime must be feeling a lot of pressure right now. You got this, slime! I believe in you! 
040I knew a date to the circus wouldn’t be romantic... She’s more interested in the slime than she is in me!
086I wonder how much practice this slime had to do to spell the words out with this much accuracy!
061This slime is very special. You can’t find a slime like this anywhere in our country! 
063The circus is lucky to have such a great money-making machine. Business must be booming here!
047Wow, I should really bring my son here for his birthday. He would love everything going on right now. 
060If the slime messed up right now, would it have the guts to continue or would it get embarrassed and run off stage?
088This slime is so adorable. Maybe I should take it and run! Wait... that would make me a criminal then! 
069I never thought I would be so entertained by a little slime, but I’m enjoying this quite a bit right now!
070Where did this circus find a slime? I’ve never seen a slime in normal wildlife anywhere!
