024If the slime slips, I’m leaving. I’m not paying my money for a crap show.
013This show is amazing! Maybe this slime isn't a humbug after all!
029God, that slime is giving me anxiety. I cannot watch this--tell me when this is over!
010Imagine if the slime messes up right now. That would be the tattle of the town. 
031Since when did slimes have the ability to do that? That’s one athletic creature...
057A slime that can walk? I think Barnum has pulled off the biggest act of the century!
026I didn’t know slimes were capable of running like that--especially on command!
020I wish tickets were cheaper. The show is great, but it's a tad bit expensive! 
046This trick is marvelous, but I am exceedingly excited to see what else the slime will do!
033I read about this in papers, but finally seeing this with my own eyes is spectacular!
015So this is the popular slime that everyone’s been talking about? I’ve seen better.
047Wow! What a slime! Barnum really has something special in its hands.
