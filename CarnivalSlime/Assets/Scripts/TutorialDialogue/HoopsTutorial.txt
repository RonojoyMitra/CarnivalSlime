This is the tutorial for the LEAPING portion of the performance.
In this game, you will be directed to a specifc key, then instructed to jump in a certain direction and magnitude.
When moving to the spcific key from which to jump, you will have to press keys tangent to the one you are on.
Fore example, to get from the key 'W' to the key 'N' the order might look like...
'W', 'S', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'B', 'N'
After this, the arrow will point in a direction and display a number.
The direction id the direction you must jump, and the number is the number of keys you must travel.
It's okay to estimate if the key is on a diagonal, go with your gut!
finish this three times to continue. 
good luck!
