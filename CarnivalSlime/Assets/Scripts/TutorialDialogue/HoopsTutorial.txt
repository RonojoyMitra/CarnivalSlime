This will be the final minigame of the performance!
This is a rehearsal for the LEAPING minigame in the performance.
In this game, you will be directed to a specifc key.
Then, you will be instructed to jump in a certain direction and magnitude.
When moving to the spcific key from which to jump, press keys tangent to the one you are on.
For example, to get from the key 'W' to the key 'N' the order might look like...
"W", "S", "D", "F", "G", "B", "N" !
After this, the arrow will point in a direction and display a number.
The direction is the direction you must jump, and the number is the number of keys you must travel.
It's okay to estimate if the key is on a diagonal--go with your gut!
Finish this three times to continue. 
Good luck!
