Onto the next minigame! 
This is a rehearsal for the MARCHING minigame in the performance.
In this game, you will have to redirect each of the many slimes on stage to a letter.
The slimes are standing in a line, and each slime in the line must follow the slime in front of them. 
The slime in the very first position will always be given a new letter each round.
You must send the first slime to its new letter. 
Then, you must send the second slime to wherever the first slime was.
Then, you must send the third slime to wherever the second slime was...
I think you get the gist! 
Once you do this for all slimes, the round will be over and you will be given a new letter. 
There are a little more than 10 "rounds" you'll need to do each day.
You'd normally have to type these letters under a time constraint...
But during this tutorial section, don't worry about it!
Just get used to the mechanics and make sure you're ready for performance day.
Good luck and don't mess up!
